## About The Project
![snake_cube_ solution](https://github.com/ahaziv/snake-cube-puzzle-solver/assets/46624561/0997d8fd-72c1-4e44-9074-8c90e81ff158)

This solver was written following a dinner at a friends house, He had this 4x4 snake cube puzzle which I picked up and couldn't solve by hand. This code was written on the next weekend so the cube could sit nice and tidy on my friends shelf. 
For whoever isn't familiar with such puzzles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzVPgFjE9c

This code was written purely for the sports of it, and I found tackling the problem pretty educational  
* It has some neat implementation of algorithmic principles (such of BFS) over 3D grid space. 
* Demonstrates how such simple problems can have high complexity.

The initial solver takes a purely brute force approach. It sets the snake end at one of several potential initial positions and then recursively, link by link tries all possible link positions. 
Stopping conditions are either reaching a solution or reaching a dead end (where no viable link placement is found).
This approach provided a highly complex solution averaging at O(1.465^n), where n is the nuber of straight links in the snake. 

To improve algorithm performance I added another stopping condition, which is reached when discontinuity of two vacant cube regions is found.
Discontinuity is found by describing the remaining vacant space as a simple undirected graph. Where each cube is a vertex and each two adjacent cube faces are an edge.
With each snake link placed, the filled in space is removed from the graph, and continuity is checked using BFS.
This addition reduced the complexity base from 1.465 to 1.309, Yet added the BFS algorithm complexity for each iteration.
All in all, I estimate and improvement of about 30% to running times (for 4 dimensional cube)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

simply load the files and run the main file (numpy and matplotlib required).


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The main script provides a few sample inputs, in order to add your own:
![flat_snake_numbered](https://github.com/ahaziv/snake-cube-puzzle-solver/assets/46624561/10a60595-31a5-414c-b2aa-bed672d787dc)
1. Unfold your snake cube in the as shown in the illustration.
2. Count the number of new steps each link of the snake has, in this case it will be: [3,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,2]
   (note that the first link will have an extra cube)
3. Insert these numbers as a list.
4. If you are attempting a different shaped cube (which is not 3x3 or 4x4) you will have to manually choose new starting points for the solution.
